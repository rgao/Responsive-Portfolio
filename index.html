                I'm a squirrel! Not really; I am actually a software engineer in-training, 
                but also am someone who really likes squirrels. I was born in China and then moved to the 
                United States when I was six. I first lived in New York for seven years before moving to 
                California at the start of my high school years. I attended UC Berkeley for five years and 
                graduated in 2016 with a B.A. in Astrophysics. I am currently enrolled in a coding program at 
                UCLA, and an online data science program through MIT. 
            </p><br><p>
                My immediate goal is to be skilled in software engineering and obtain a decent entry level
                job in the tech industry. Originally, while I knew I wanted to study Astrophysics, I did not 
                know which path to pursue with my studies. I regretfully did not live up to my expectations
                and the academic path is now very difficult for my to rejoin. Now, through the coding boot 
                camp, I want to augment my skills in programming and learn to use various relevant technology.
                After mastering the lessons taughts here, I would carry over the skills to hopefully my new 
                job and also to supplement learning data analysis. Eventually, I would want to seek a career in 
                data science, beginning with data analysis and data visualization. My ultimate goal is to 
                become a data science and earn a path towards pursuing a Master's in Data Science or Astronomy.
            </p><br><p>
                During my free time, I enjoy gaming and reading up on contemporary politics and science. I also
                love exploring and discovering! Whenever I'm in a new area, I impulsively walk or around the 
                region or building; when I learn something interesting or new, I will look up additional info 
                on the internet. One of my favorite ways to spend time, especially when in a new place, is to 
                find quality local cafes to relax or do work in. One of my goals is to travel the world,
                including Scandinavia and Oceania, and explore the various localities.
